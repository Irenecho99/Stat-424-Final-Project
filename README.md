# Way to Successful Instagram Account 
UW-Madison Stat-424

# Abstract
Instagram in today’s society has become the main social channel that has the highest average
engagement rate. Users promote their business, restaurant, and even themselves through the use of
this social media. In this project, I am going to figure out what makes the Instagram account
successful.

Successful Instagram in quantitative meaning, is that the owner of the account has credibility just
by one’s social account, can persuade others with one’s authenticity, and has a brand of one’s own.
In qualitative meaning, successful account means that the account has more than 30M (thirty
million) followers. I will test 9 different Instagram account in this project. The response variable
for this project is number of followers that differ by three factors given.

The three factors that I am going to implement is:
• If the user includes biography in his/her profile
• If the user uploads his/her selfie frequently (more than three times a week)
• If the user has more than 5,000 posts in his/her account
